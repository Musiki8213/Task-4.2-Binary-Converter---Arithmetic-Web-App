# Binary Converter & Arithmetic Web App

---

## 🎯 Project Overview
This web application allows users to:
- Convert numbers between decimal and binary systems.
- Perform binary arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication).
- Solve binary expressions using BODMAS rules.
- View a styled ASCII table with binary codes, HTML numbers, and descriptions.

The project demonstrates understanding of number systems, logical operations, and frontend web development.

## 🔍 Research & Layout Inspiration
I explored at least two existing binary conversion websites to gather UI/UX ideas.

## 🖊️ Wireframe
A hand-drawn wireframe was created to plan the app layout. It includes:
- Input sections for decimal and binary numbers
- Conversion buttons
- Binary arithmetic calculator (add, subtract, multiply)
- BODMAS expression section
- ASCII table

## 🧱 App Structure

### 📄 HTML (`index.html`)
The structure includes:
- `<section>` for each main component
- `<form>` for input and conversion
- Buttons for arithmetic operations
- `<table>` for the ASCII table
- Semantic HTML tags for accessibility

### 🎨 CSS (`App.css`)
- Clean, responsive, and intuitive design
- Consistent color scheme and typography
- Bonus: accessibility features and mobile-friendly layout

### 🧠 JavaScript (`App.js`)
Implemented functionality:
1. **Decimal ↔ Binary Conversion**
2. **Binary Arithmetic**: addition, subtraction, multiplication
3. **BODMAS Support**: evaluate complex binary expressions
4. **Result Display**: dynamic display of calculation results

## 💡 ASCII Table Extension
The ASCII table displays:
- Symbol
- Binary Code
- HTML Number
- Description

All symbols (0–9, a–z, A–Z) are included on individual rows.
